# datomic-ltl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dwhjames/datomic-ltl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dwhjames/datomic-ltl)

An experimental interpretation of
[Linear Temporal Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic)
(LTL) for [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/).
Please read the
[documentation](https://dwhjames.github.io/datomic-ltl/index.html) to
understand what is being attempted here. Some basic examples are
illustrated in a [scratch file](scratch/scratch.clj), which you can
explore at the repl.
